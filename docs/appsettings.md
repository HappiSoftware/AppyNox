# Appsettings Configurations

First of all it's good the understand the project structure. AppyNox uses all the **functions of stages of development** `(Development, Staging, Production)`.

Since appsettings.Production files are gitignored, you must create the `appsettings.Production.json` files manually if you are going to use it. You can copy the content of `appsettings.json` to the created json files and fill the content.
